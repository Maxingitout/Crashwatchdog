============================== CRASHWATCHDOG ==============================

CrashWatchDog is a Windows desktop utility for monitoring game processes for
crashes, hangs, and system performance issues. It features a custom
Matrix-style interface and is designed for PC gamers and power users who want
clear visibility into application stability during gameplay.

CrashWatchDog is distributed as a standalone Windows installer with a guided
setup wizard.

Created by Nick Hall (Maxingitout).

============================== WHAT IT DOES ==============================

CrashWatchDog monitors running applications and system resources to help
identify crashes, freezes, and performance anomalies.

Key capabilities include:

• Automatic detection of installed Steam games
• Tiled game interface with extracted game icons
• Real-time CPU and memory monitoring
• Game process crash detection
• Hang detection for unresponsive applications
• Automatic stop of monitoring when a game exits

CrashWatchDog is a passive monitoring tool and does not modify games or interact
with anti-cheat systems.
